Dear vendor,

Good day!

I’m writing to ask for a price reduction since we need to make an order soon and would like to request a 10% discount.

The most recent order as below:
Product A: 60,000 units - $54,000
Product B: 40,000 units - $36,000
Total payment - $90,000

I’m waiting for your kind response before placing order.

Thanks and regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
[Your Company]
